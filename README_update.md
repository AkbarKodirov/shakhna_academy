# Update — Teacher-only HTML Upload Integrated

I merged the teacher-only HTML upload workflow into your uploaded design.

What I added:
- `teacher_dashboard.html` — teachers can upload `.html` CDI tests.
- `assets/js/airtable.js` — client placeholders to call server endpoints (`/api/upload_test`, `/api/public_tests`, `/api/my_tests`).
- `server_example.js` — Node.js Express template to host uploaded HTML files and to demo endpoints.
- `assets/js/auth.js` — small demo auth helper.

Important notes:
- Keep Airtable API keys and Telegram Bot token on server-side only.
- To fully enable Airtable/Telegram, update `server_example.js` to use Airtable SDK and Telegram Bot API with your keys.
- Uploaded test HTML files will be served from `/uploads/<filename>.html`. Design those test HTML files so that the Submit button is fixed at bottom-right inside the HTML (CSS `position: fixed; right: 20px; bottom: 20px;`).

If you want, I can now:
- Add Airtable integration to `server_example.js` (create records automatically).
- Add Telegram notifications on upload/grade.
- Or I can tune the UI (colors/logo) as per your branding.

Tell me which of those to add next, or I can produce the updated ZIP now.
